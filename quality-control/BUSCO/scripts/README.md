# BUSCO for genomes analysis

## 01_busco

BUSCO was run using a combination of arrays via the Duke Computing Cluster (DCC) and normally as single run. The majority of the genomes analyzed were conducted via the arrays format. Some genomes needed to be re-run. I did this by copying the genomes into a seperate folder and running again via the arrays or solo by calling them by file name.
